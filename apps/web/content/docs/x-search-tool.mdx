## What is x_search?

Grok has a built-in `x_search` tool that allows it to search X (Twitter) in real-time during conversations. This is unique to Grok and enables it to provide current information from X.

## Enabling x_search

When using the Grok API, you can enable the `x_search` tool:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai"

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://api.x.ai/v1",
})

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "grok-3-latest",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What are people saying about TypeScript 5.0 on X right now?",
    },
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "x_search",
        description: "Search X (Twitter) for real-time posts and discussions",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            query: {
              type: "string",
              description: "Search query for X",
            },
          },
          required: ["query"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

## How Grok Uses x_search

When Grok determines that real-time X data would be helpful, it:

1. Formulates a search query based on the user's question
2. Calls `x_search` internally
3. Retrieves and processes recent posts
4. Synthesizes the information into a response

<Callout type="info">
The x_search tool is Grok's native capability. You don't need to implement the search logic; Grok handles it automatically.
</Callout>

## Example Prompts

Prompts that typically trigger x_search:

```typescript
const prompts = [
  "What's trending on X about AI right now?",
  "What are developers saying about the new React update?",
  "Find recent discussions about startup funding on X",
  "What's the sentiment around Tesla stock on X today?",
  "Show me what people are posting about the NBA finals",
]
```

## Streaming with x_search

```typescript
const stream = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "grok-3-latest",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What are the latest posts about Bun.js on X?",
    },
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "x_search",
        description: "Search X for real-time posts",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            query: { type: "string" },
          },
          required: ["query"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
  stream: true,
})

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  const content = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content
  if (content) {
    process.stdout.write(content)
  }

  // Handle tool calls in stream
  const toolCalls = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.tool_calls
  if (toolCalls) {
    for (const tc of toolCalls) {
      console.log("Tool call:", tc.function?.name)
    }
  }
}
```

## Combining with Other Tools

You can combine x_search with your own tools:

```typescript
const tools = [
  {
    type: "function" as const,
    function: {
      name: "x_search",
      description: "Search X for real-time posts",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          query: { type: "string" },
        },
        required: ["query"],
      },
    },
  },
  {
    type: "function" as const,
    function: {
      name: "get_stock_price",
      description: "Get current stock price",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          symbol: { type: "string" },
        },
        required: ["symbol"],
      },
    },
  },
]

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "grok-3-latest",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "What's NVDA stock price and what are people saying about Nvidia on X?",
    },
  ],
  tools,
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Clear queries yield better search results
2. **Mention X explicitly** - Helps Grok know to use x_search
3. **Ask for recent data** - "right now", "today", "latest" signals real-time need
4. **Combine with analysis** - Ask Grok to summarize sentiment or key themes

## Limitations

- Results depend on X's real-time data availability
- Search depth may vary based on query complexity
- Rate limits apply to API calls
- Not all X content is searchable (private accounts, etc.)
